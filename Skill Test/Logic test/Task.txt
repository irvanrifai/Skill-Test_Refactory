1. Biggest Number
Description:
Create a function that takes one positive three digit integer and rearranges its digits to get the maximum possible number. Assume that the argument is an integer.

Returm null if the argument is invalid.

maxRedigit(123) --> 321
maxRedigit(231) --> 321
maxRedigit(321) --> 321

maxRedigit(-1)  --> null 
maxRedigit(0)   --> null
maxRedigit(99)  --> null
maxRedigit(1000) --> null



2. Map Array Data
Given an array/list [] of integers , Construct a product array Of same size Such That prod[i] is equal to The Product of all the elements of Arr[] except Arr[i].

productArray([12,20])           => [20,12]
productArray([12,20])           => [20,12]
productArray([3,27,4,2])        => [216,24,162,324]
productArray([13,10,5,2,9])     => [900,1170,2340,5850,1300]
productArray([16,17,4,3,5,2])   => [2040,1920,8160,10880,6528,16320]



3. Alternate Case
Alternate each case of each of string given 

alternateCase("abc")            => "ABC"
alternateCase("ABC")            => "abc"
alternateCase("Hello World")    => "hELLO wORLD"



4. Multiple 3 and 5
Create solution function that accept 1 parameter that be will multiple number 3 and 5 while each result of that multiplication is still lower than parameter inputed

solution (10) // => 23 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9
solution (20) // => 78 = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 18



5. Nearest Fibonacci
Have the function to find nearest Fibonacci numbers, that the parameter is array.
Example Input: 
arr = [15,1,3]
then your program expected to made output = 2

Why Output is 2?

Because by the above input example [15,1,3], if we add up them it will 15+1+3 = 19, and the nearest fibonacci of 19 is 21, so we need to add 2 then it can be 21. So, the correct answer is 2.



6. Reverse Words
Create a function that receive input and will give output:

Reverse each word of these:

"I am A Great human"
into
"I ma A Taerg namuh"

// note: observe the Capital word behavior. Capital only when in the first letter



7. Find Middle Alphabet
Given variable string contains of all alphabet from A to Z
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

Build a function that receive two paramters: first letter and last letter.
That will do to find middle letter between of the specified letter.
Example: 

- The middle between Q and U is S
- The middle between R and U is ST
- The middle between T and Z is W
- The middle between Q and Z is UV
